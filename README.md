# AER1516 Project - A Study on FMT* and BFMT*
This is for the final project of AER1516 Motion Planning course
The objective of this project is to study the FMT* algorithm (paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.3532.pdf) and BFMT* algorithm (paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.07602.pdf).
The python implementation of FMT* is based on https://github.com/zhm-real/PathPlanning#papers and the implemention of BFMT* is based on the pseudocode outlined in the paper.
